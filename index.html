            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.[1] Education originated as
                transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
                encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information,
                skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.[85]


                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[86] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.[87]

                In China, Confucius (551â€“479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient
                philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like
                Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt
                his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by followers and have continued to
                influence education in East Asia into the modern era.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Joseph Chimombo pointed out education's role as a policy instrument,
                capable of instilling social change and economic advancement in developing countries by giving
                communities the opportunity to take control of their destinies.[98] The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
                Development, adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in September 2015, calls for a new
                vision to address the environmental, social and economic concerns facing the world today. The Agenda
                includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 4 on education.[99][100]

                Since 1909, the percentage of children in the developing world attending school has increased. Before
                then, a small minority of boys attended school. By the start of the twenty-first century, the majority
                of children in most regions of the world attended some form of school.[101] By 2016, over 91 percent of
                children are enrolled in formal primary schooling.[101] However, a learning crisis has emerged across
                the globe, due to the fact that a large proportion of students enrolled in school are not learning. A
                World Bank study found that "53 percent of children in low- and middle-income countries cannot read and
                understand a simple story by the end of primary school."[102] While schooling has increased rapidly over
                the last few decades, learning has not followed suit.</p>
